                <p class="text-body">To our potential recruits: I am so glad you stumbled upon Delta Sigma Pi â€“ Sigma Omega
                    Chapter. However you arrived here, whether intentionally or by sheer luck, you have opened the doors
                    to your future. Sigma Omega offers Northeastern students the exceptional opportunity to gain business
                    experience, network with top professionals, and most importantly, form a lifelong bond of brotherhood.
                    As you begin your recruitment process into the Delta Sigma Pi fraternity, I reiterate that as much as
                    we want you to learn more about the fraternity and Sigma Omega as a chapter, we also want to learn more
                    about you as individuals. We are so excited to meet all of you bright, talented individuals that can
                    add so much to our fraternity as well as take away from it. We may start as strangers now, but hopefully
                    we will end up as brothers. I highly encourage you to attend our recruitment events and learn more about
                    becoming a part of our fraternity. I am so excited for the start of what could be a spectacular journey.
                    Sincerely, Jenn Kang Vice President of Pledge Education
